# Readers and providers
Classes made for conversion bytes from stream to data, and data to stream bytes.

Some providers and readers must be created in runtime (example: [LJsonReader](../api_reference/LJsonReader.md), and [LJsonProvider](../api_reference/LJsonProvider.md)), but most of it you can get in `lutils.readers` and `lutils.providers`
